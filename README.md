Exquisite Corpse
----------------

Procedural generation of exquisite corpses parametrised by:

- a chunk size
- a sentence used as seed
- a corpus

E.g. based on [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11),
running `ExquisiteCorpse 6 "The sun was red that morning." data/pg11.txt` delivers:

```
The sun was red that morning.
I almost think I can remember
half of them--and it belongs to
her: its face was quite pale
beloved snail, but come and join
the dance? Will you, won't you,
won't you, won't you join the
whiting!' 'Oh, as to the whiting,'
'I never thought about it,' said
the Gryphon. 'I mean, what makes
my forehead ache!' Alice watched the
list, feeling very curious to see
this, as she was near enough
```
